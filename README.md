# custom_robo_model_swapper
Model swapper for Custom Robo for the Gamecube!

This is an app designed to allow people to give different characters different models in Custom Robo for the GameCube. 
It includes an easy to use front-end that creates the modified files, which the user then manually puts into their ROM. 

There are limitations to the app, but the two biggest ones are:
  1. The model being overwritten has to have an equal or smaller file size than the replacement model.
  2. There is no patcher for the ROM, so the user has to manually replace the files in the ROM.
  
Workarounds and changes that would resolve these issues may come in the future, but I haven't started working on either and
can't guarantee that they will even happen at all.
